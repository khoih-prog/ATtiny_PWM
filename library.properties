sentence=This library enables you to use Hardware-based PWM channels on Arduino AVR ATtiny-based boards (ATtiny3217, etc.), using megaTinyCore, to create and output PWM to pins.
paragraph=Using the same functions as other FastPWM libraries to enable you to port PWM code easily between platforms. The most important feature is they are purely hardware-based PWM channels, supporting very high PWM frequencies. Therefore, their executions are not blocked by bad-behaving functions or tasks. This important feature is absolutely necessary for mission-critical tasks. These hardware-based PWMs, still work even if other software functions are blocking. Moreover, they are much more precise (certainly depending on clock frequency accuracy) than other software-based PWM using ISR, millis() or micros(). That is necessary if you need to control devices requiring high precision. New efficient setPWM_manual function to facilitate waveform creation using PWM
